        <img src="assets/images/boston.jpeg">
        <p>My name is Boston Jones. I am married and am living in St. George, Utah. My wife and
            I have been married and living here for just over two years. I have been working as
            a technician at ChemDry for about 3 years.
        </p>
        <p>While work is very important to me, I also have many hobbies that I like to do in my
            leisure time. Playing basketball has got to be my favorite. I also love to get out on
            the golf course with some friends and just have a great time.

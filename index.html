            <p>My name is Boston Jones. I am married and am living in St. George, Utah. My wife and
                I have been married and living here for just over two years. I have been working as
                a technician at ChemDry for about 3 years. I am currently working toward becoming a 
                Web Developer. Just from the amount of time I have put into learning the skills needed
                to be a Web Developer, I have found that I really enjoy coding and am very excited for 
                the future.

            <p>While work is very important to me, I also have many hobbies that I like to do in my
                leisure time. Playing basketball has got to be my favorite. I also love to get out on
                the golf course with some friends and just have a great time.
